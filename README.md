<p align="center"> ü§ñ A Discord Bot to verify MAL club members and MAL simple utility commands.
    <br>
</p>

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Ryuuzaki Ryuusei is a Discord bot that can be used to verify MAL club members and MAL simple utility commands like user stats and anime lookup while it keeping simple and easy to use, also respecting users under GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, and other privacy laws.

The bot is fully powered by slash commands and is currently in alpha testing.

## üéà Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

To use the bot, invite it to your server using this link:

[![Shield](https://img.shields.io/badge/Invite%20to%20your%20server-7289DA?style=for-the-badge&logo=discord&logoColor=white)](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=811887256368840744&permissions=274878221376&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

Next, go to the channel you want to use the bot in and type `/` to see the list of available commands.

Currently the bot was self-hosted, so it's might not available 24/7, but it get the job done. Although, I'll try to keep it online as much as possible.

All data invoked from `/register` will be stored in [database.csv](database/database.csv), user is able to delete their data by using `/unregister` command. Most commands can be used without `/register` command, although it may limit your experience using it.

If you have any questions, feel free to join the [support server](https://nttds.my.id/discord) and ask there.

## üöÄ Features <a name = "features"></a>

> This also will be our to-do list for the bot. :3

- [x] MAL account verification (only for self-hosted bot).
- [x] Privacy-friendly: no data is stored on the bot's server, except for the user's Discord ID and MAL username. See [Privacy Policy](docs/PRIVACY_POLICY.md) for more information.

- [x] ~~**100% Approved by Kagamine Len**[^2]~~

[^1]: The random seed was generated using UUID4 and truncated to 32 bits (`pandas` couldn't able to get a sample using a seed above 32 bits unfortunately), and this seed generation happened ***everytime*** user invoked command. I can not guarantee the randomness as it is not the true random as in cryptographically secure random, but it's good enough that you should have hard time to get the same result twice in a row.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of `python`, `pip`, and `git`.
- Has a Discord bot token.

### Installing

To install Ryuuzaki Ryuusei, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nattadasu/ryuuRyuusei.git
cd ryuuRyuusei
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note**
> If you're using Termux, you may need to modify `pip` line to:
>
> ```bash
> MATHLIB="m" pip install -r requirements.txt
> ```

> **Note**
> You can also run `firstRun.py` to install all of required modules automatically.

Next, you need to do an initial setup for the bot. Run `firstRun.py` and let the bot create the required files and install dependencies that hosted in GitHub instead of PyPI:

```bash
python ./firstRun.py
```

Then, when `pip` finished installing all of required modules, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill the required fields.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Finally, run the bot using `python` command:

```bash
python ./main.py
```

**Note**: You can also use `python3` instead of `python` if you have multiple versions of Python installed. By default (and also `firstRun.py` behavior), the bot will use `python3`/`python` that is currently in your `PATH` environment variable.

## üéâ Acknowledgements <a name = "acknowledgement"></a>

- Karasian, for creating the verification bot for The Newbie Club Discord server
- Lacrima, YubiYuub, and Mental Illness, for helping me with the bot
- [White Cat](https://whitecat.app/), for the ability to link MAL account to Discord account and profile can be invoked anywhere.
- And nearly all of the Discord bots with MAL functionalities, for inspiring me to create this bot... as most of bots didn't offer much information about the title compared to some (including this), smh.
- *And finally, a honorable mention to PowerShell, because it's literally my real first scripting language I learned, and because of it, I can create this bot in python... somehow, cough cough.*
